I'm Suxin Ji, a data engineer with a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of scalable systems and intelligent automation. My work centers around designing and deploying robust data pipelines, optimizing infrastructure for analytics and machine learning, and enabling organizations to make faster, smarter, and more data-informed decisions.

I bring hands-on expertise in tools and technologies like Python, SQL, PySpark, Kafka, and machine learning frameworks such as ARIMA and Prophet, alongside platforms like Incorta. I have experience developing end-to-end solutions, including API development, metadata connectors, forecasting models, and scalable data visualization. My contributions have spanned both product-facing features and behind-the-scenes infrastructure.

Beyond technical execution, I’m deeply committed to collaboration, ownership, and results. I thrive in cross-functional teams, where my ability to communicate clearly, adapt quickly, and lead through ambiguity helps bridge engineering and business. I'm known for being solution-oriented, resilient under pressure, and motivated by impact. Whether it's debugging a pipeline failure, launching a tutorial that supports a new user, or streamlining data workflows to save engineering hours — I bring focus and follow-through to everything I do.

I also actively contribute to the data community, having been recognized as a top contributor in the Incorta Community Forum, and have created technical video tutorials to support user onboarding and knowledge sharing. My values are rooted in integrity, continuous learning, and leading by example — both in the code I write and in the teams I support.
